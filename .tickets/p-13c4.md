# Workflow should mark tickets as "needs testing" as last step, not complete

The last agentic step in the core workflow should update the ticket status to "needs testing" signaling that the agent is complete with the ticket and human (or agent) testing is required


## Notes

**2026-01-26T07:00:29Z**

## Root Cause

Both workflow skills (`create-feature` and `create-bug`) set ticket status to `closed` in their final "Push & Close" phase, but they should set it to `needs_testing` to signal that human/agent testing is required before closure.

**Affected files:**
- `skills/create-feature/SKILL.md:178` - Phase 8
- `skills/create-bug/SKILL.md:134` - Phase 7

## Fix

Changed `--status closed` to `--status needs_testing` in both files and renamed phase headers from "Push & Close" to "Push".
