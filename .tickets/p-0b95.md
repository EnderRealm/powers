# Update root CLAUDE.md

Add workflow principles to global instructions

## Design

File: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
Add/update sections:
- Development Workflow section referencing /create-feature, /create-bug, /work-ticket
- Commit format: [ticket-id] description (remove Co-authored-by requirement)
- Decision documentation: always recommend, include reasoning
- Error handling rules (retry self-inflicted, stop on environmental)
- Testing approach (integration tests, use running services)
Keep existing sections: Protocol Zero, Role Definition, Relationship rules

## Acceptance Criteria

CLAUDE.md reflects workflow decisions, no conflicts with existing rules
