# Document ticket structure conventions

Define standard ticket structure for workflow

## Design

Create docs/TICKET-CONVENTIONS.md covering:
- ## Learnings section (greppable for mining)
- Inline **Decision:** with (auto)/(human) tags
- <!-- checkpoint: phase --> comments for resume
- Test results format: timestamp + pass/fail counts
- Bug tickets: root cause documentation
- Phase-specific update patterns (execute, test, finalize)

## Acceptance Criteria

Conventions documented, examples for each pattern
