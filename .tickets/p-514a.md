# Create PROJECT.md template

Template for project-specific facts and service configuration

## Design

Create templates/PROJECT.md covering:
- Services section (dev URLs, ports, health checks)
- Testing configuration (Puppeteer settings, test commands)
- Environment notes (what's running in watch mode)
Near-term: port/tmux checking instructions
Long-term: Manager API integration placeholder

## Acceptance Criteria

Template usable for new projects, clear separation from CLAUDE.md
