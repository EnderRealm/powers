# Implement Development Workflow

Structured workflow for feature and bug development with ticket-driven execution

## Design

Three entry points: /create-feature, /create-bug, /work-ticket
Feature flow: brainstorm → create ticket → plan → execute → test → finalize → commit → push
Bug flow: create ticket → investigate → fix → test → update → commit → push
Ticket structure: ## Learnings section, inline **Decision:** markers, checkpoint comments
Modes: interactive (default), --auto for autonomous execution
Near-term: port/tmux checking for services
Long-term: Manager API integration

## Acceptance Criteria

All three skills functional, CLAUDE.md files updated, workflow documented
