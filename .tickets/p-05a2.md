# Create work-ticket skill

Skill to resume work on existing ticket based on type and state

## Design

Files: skills/work-ticket/SKILL.md, commands/work-ticket.md
Input: ticket ID
Behavior:
1. Read ticket via tk show <id>
2. Determine type (feature vs bug)
3. Read checkpoint comment to find last phase
4. Reason about what makes sense next (can loop back if plan is wrong)
5. Resume appropriate flow from current state
Support --auto flag inherited from parent skills
Session continuity via checkpoint + reasoning

## Acceptance Criteria

Skill correctly resumes feature or bug flow based on ticket state
