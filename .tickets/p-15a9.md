# Skills should use needs_testing status before closing

The create-bug and create-feature skills skip the needs_testing status entirely. The bug skill goes straight from commit to closed in Phase 7. The work-ticket skill has no checkpoint or phase that maps to needs_testing. This means tickets that require human verification (e.g. mobile device testing) get closed before they're actually verified.

## Design

Files: skills/create-bug/SKILL.md, skills/create-feature/SKILL.md, skills/work-ticket/SKILL.md

create-bug: Phase 7 currently does tk edit --status closed immediately. Should set needs_testing after commit when verification requires human input. If the agent fully verified the fix (e.g. via Puppeteer), it can go straight to closed. If not (e.g. needs physical device testing), set needs_testing.

create-feature: Same pattern — after commit, set needs_testing if human verification is needed.

work-ticket: Add needs_testing to the checkpoint/status flow so resuming a ticket in needs_testing state makes sense (proceed to close after verification).

The tk workflow guide already documents needs_testing correctly. The skills just need to use it.

## Acceptance Criteria

Bug and feature skills set tickets to needs_testing when human verification is required before closing. work-ticket skill handles needs_testing status correctly when resuming.
