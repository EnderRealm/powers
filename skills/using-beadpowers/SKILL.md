**If even 1% chance a skill applies, YOU MUST invoke it. Not negotiable.**

## Access

Use the `Skill` tool with `beadpowers:` prefix. Follow skill content directly. Never Read skill files.

## The Rule

Invoke skills BEFORE any response or action. If wrong for situation, you don't need to use it.

## Red Flags (you're rationalizing)

- "Just a simple question" → Questions are tasks. Check skills.
- "Need context first" → Skill check comes BEFORE exploration.
- "I'll do this one thing first" → Check BEFORE doing anything.
- "Skill is overkill" → Simple becomes complex. Use it.

## Priority

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming) - HOW to approach
2. **Implementation skills second** (create-beads) - guide execution

"Build X" → brainstorming first, then create-beads.

## Available Skills

- `beadpowers:brainstorming` - Design refinement before implementation
- `beadpowers:create-beads` - Create epics/tasks from designs
